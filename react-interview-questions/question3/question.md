# Question 3: Implement a Weather Dashboard application in React with TypeScript.

Build a feature-rich Weather Dashboard application and should meet the following requirements:

- Data Fetching: Fetch weather data from a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
- Dynamic Rendering: Display the current weather, a 5-day forecast, and additional weather details such as humidity and wind speed.
- Component Organization: Use functional components and hooks to manage state and effects.
- Error Handling: Implement error handling for network requests.
- Context API: Use the Context API to manage global state (e.g., user preferences like temperature units).
- TypeScript: Ensure all components and hooks are strongly typed.
- Styling: Use CSS-in-JS (e.g., styled-components) for component styling.
- Testing: Write unit tests for key components using React Testing Library and Jest.
